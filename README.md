## Features

1. Yeetsonified: Replaces boring old curly braces {} with exciting new `<yeetson` and `yeetson>` delimiters.
2. Jazzleberg-ified: Swaps out square brackets [] for stylish `<jazzleberg` and `jazzleberg>` tags!
3. Comma--free: Replaces commas , with superior pipes, because I wanna pipe Jason.
4. Readability: This code is so readable
5. Not JSON: This is definitely not just JSON and we are not using definitely under the hood.
6. JSON compatiable: but only one way. Turn your JSON into JASON so it works out of the box with JSON. However, it does not work the other way.
